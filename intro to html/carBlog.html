            DOHA – At first glance, the Simurgh resembles the Batmobile. Black, low-slung with flared wheel arches, 
            the supercar looks built for speed.Look a bit closer though, and it is clear this car is different from 
            the dozens of other vehicles on display at the Doha edition of the Geneva International Motor Show.
            The sealing on the windshield is uneven, and visitors were not allowed to open the doors – because 
            the interiors have not been finished yet. But perhaps the Simurgh’s most unusual feature is its country of origin: 
            Afghanistan, where the Taliban seized control two years ago.
            The car is the brainchild of a group of young Afghan engineers who have been working on the project for the past two years.
             They say they want to show the world that Afghanistan is more than just a war-torn country.
